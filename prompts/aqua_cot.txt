Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these. Answer:
Let's think step by step. 

Let's denote the height of the tower as h and the speed of the car as v.
Let's denote the distance from the car to the tower at the moment when the angle of elevation is 45° as d₁.
Let's denote the distance from the car to the tower at the moment when the angle of elevation is 60° as d₂.

When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:
tan(45°) = h/d₁
h/d₁ = 1
h = d₁

When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
tan(60°) = h/d₂
h/d₂ = √3
h = d₂ × √3

The car travels at a uniform speed, so:
d₁ - d₂ = v × 10 minutes

We want to find how much more time it will take to reach the tower from the position where the angle of elevation is 60°. This is:
d₂ / v

From h = d₁, we get d₁ = h.
From h = d₂ × √3, we get d₂ = h/√3.

So, d₁ - d₂ = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3 = v × 10 minutes.

Solving for h:
h = v × 10 minutes × √3/(√3 - 1)

Now, the time to reach the tower from the position where the angle of elevation is 60° is:
d₂ / v = (h/√3) / v = h/(v × √3)

Substituting the value of h:
h/(v × √3) = (v × 10 minutes × √3/(√3 - 1))/(v × √3) = 10 minutes × √3/(√3 - 1) × 1/√3 = 10 minutes × 1/(√3 - 1) = 10 minutes × (√3 + 1)/2 = 5 minutes × (√3 + 1)

So, the car will reach the base of the tower in 5(√3 + 1) minutes from the position where the angle of elevation is 60°.

The answer is (A) 5(√3 + 1).
