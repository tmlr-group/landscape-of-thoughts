Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these. Answer:

Let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: Let's define the variables.
- h = height of the tower
- v = speed of the car
- d₁ = distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°
- d₂ = distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°

Step 2: Let's use trigonometry to relate the angles to the distances.
When the angle of elevation is 45°:
tan(45°) = h/d₁
1 = h/d₁
h = d₁

When the angle of elevation is 60°:
tan(60°) = h/d₂
√3 = h/d₂
h = d₂ × √3

Step 3: Let's relate the distances to the time.
The car travels at a uniform speed, so:
d₁ - d₂ = v × 10 minutes

Step 4: Let's find the time it will take to reach the tower from the position where the angle of elevation is 60°.
Time = d₂ / v

Step 5: Let's substitute the values.
From h = d₁, we get d₁ = h.
From h = d₂ × √3, we get d₂ = h/√3.

So, d₁ - d₂ = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3 = v × 10 minutes.

Step 6: Let's solve for h.
h = v × 10 minutes × √3/(√3 - 1)

Step 7: Let's calculate the time.
Time = d₂ / v = (h/√3) / v = h/(v × √3)

Substituting the value of h:
Time = (v × 10 minutes × √3/(√3 - 1))/(v × √3) = 10 minutes × √3/(√3 - 1) × 1/√3 = 10 minutes × 1/(√3 - 1) = 10 minutes × (√3 + 1)/2 = 5 minutes × (√3 + 1)

So, the car will reach the base of the tower in 5(√3 + 1) minutes from the position where the angle of elevation is 60°.

The answer is (A) 5(√3 + 1).
